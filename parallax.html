        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm a second-year student enrolled in the College of Arts
            and Sciences studying philosophy and economics. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still trying to figure out what I'd like to do for my career, so 
            I'm open to listening to anyone's work experience! 
        </p>
        <p>I grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, but have lived in
            Atlanta, Georgia for the past seven years of my life. Below
            is a picture of Atlanta!

        <p>I love music, running and fishing.</p>
        <p>I started playing the guitar four years ago and continue
            to play today. My favorite bands and artists to cover right
            now are the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jimi Hendrix.
        </p>
        <p>I started running in high-school. I joined the track & field team
            and then the cross-country team (both of which didn't cut atheltes)
            because my best friends ran. After high-school, I didn't spend much time
            running. However, once the pandemic hit, running became one of my favorite
            hobbies. I just finished my first marathon on April 10!
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew up fishing with my grandpa. He spent much of his youth
            fishing in the Philipines until he immigrated to the United States
            to become a doctor. I am so grateful for all the lessons he taught
            me over the years. This coming summer, I'm planning on working under
            a charter captain as a mate in Ocean City, Maryland. Scroll down
            to see a picture of the Ocean City inlet in the mornings!
